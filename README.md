## Overview

Play notes on a music staff, in order to assist with singing or playing, while reading music.  Helps to learn notes.

## Background

Used the Cursor editor with Claude Sonnet 3.5 to create the bulk of the code, using multiple prompts, and manual editing to make adjustments.  The code is probably less than optimal as a result of relying so heavily on AI, however, this greatly sped up the development.
